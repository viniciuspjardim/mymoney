My Money is a web app written in TypeScript / React that allow
you to keep track of your income and expenditures. It uses
[Mirage](https://miragejs.com/) to mock the API, so we
can focus on developing the front-end, even if the API is not
ready.

It's a simple app to showcase my abilities with the React stack.
